## Data residency

- Primary region: `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt).
- Backups replicated to `eu-west-1`.
- Media assets stored in S3 with regional replication and customer-managed keys.

## DSR pipeline

1. User triggers delete/export in-app.
2. `users` row marked `pending_deletion` and scheduled via `purge_scheduled_at`.
3. Retention job (`pnpm retention:run`) processes due deletions, dropping linked
   sessions, exercises, media, follower edges, and anonymising audit trails.
4. `user_tombstones` record is created for compliance evidence until backups are
   purged.
5. Backups older than 14 days are removed automatically; ad-hoc purge tickets
   track accelerated deletion if needed.

See `apps/docs/2c.Technical_Design_Document _Data.md` §6.8 for detailed table
retention requirements.
