# FitVibe Privacy Notice (MVP)

**Effective date:** 26 October 2025  
**Controller:** FitVibe Labs Ltd.  
**Contact:** privacy@fitvibe.app

This notice explains what personal data we collect when you use FitVibe, why we
collect it, how we process it, and the rights you have under the GDPR and UK
Data Protection Act.

## 1. What data we collect

| Category                     | Examples                                                       | Source                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Account data                 | Email, username, password hash                                 | Provided by you       |
| Profile & preferences        | Display name, locale, units, avatar, contact preferences       | Provided by you       |
| Workout content              | Sessions, exercises, sets, notes, media uploads                | Provided by you       |
| Social graph                 | Followers, likes, comments, share links                        | Provided by you       |
| Gamification data            | Points ledger, badges, leaderboards                            | Derived from usage    |
| Device & security metadata   | Auth sessions, IPs, user agents, audit log events              | Generated by service  |
| Support & compliance events  | Abuse reports, moderation actions, DSR requests                | Generated by service  |

We do **not** intentionally process special category data. Users should avoid
storing health details in free-form notes beyond planned workout information.

## 2. Lawful basis & purpose

- **Contractual necessity** – account management, workout planning/logging,
  gamification features.
- **Legitimate interests** – fraud prevention, basic analytics, service
  improvement. We balance these interests against your rights.
- **Consent** – marketing communication (opt-in), public feed visibility, share
  links.
- **Legal obligation** – responding to law enforcement requests, record keeping
  for DSR actions.

## 3. Retention

- Account, workouts, and social graph data is kept while your account remains
  active. When you delete your account we queue deletion after the configured
  grace period (default 7 days) and purge backups within 14 days (see data map).
- Auth tokens, idempotency records, and moderation queues are pruned on rolling
  schedules (24h–180d) as automated jobs.
- Audit logs are retained for 180 days.

## 4. Data sharing & processors

We rely on sub-processors for infrastructure (AWS), email delivery, and error
reporting. Each processor signs a DPA covering confidentiality, security, and
SCCs where required. A full list is maintained internally and shared on request.
We never sell your personal data.

## 5. Your rights

You can exercise these rights via the in-app privacy center or by emailing
privacy@fitvibe.app:

- Access, rectification, deletion (GDPR Art. 15–17)
- Restriction and objection (Art. 18–21)
- Data portability (Art. 20)
- Withdraw consent (Art. 7)
- Lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority

Deletion requests are executed by our automated DSR service which cascades
through workouts, media, follower relationships, and audit logs. Backups are
purged within 14 days of completion.

## 6. Security

- TLS 1.2+ everywhere, HSTS, OCSP stapling, strict content-security-policy.
- Zero-trust production access, MFA, secrets manager, role-based deployment.
- Malware scanning for uploads, anomaly monitoring, audit trail for key actions.

## 7. Changes

We will update this notice when functionality or legal requirements change. The
document lives in version control (`apps/docs/policies/Privacy_Policy.md`) with
history and approvals recorded. Material changes are communicated in-product
and via email.
