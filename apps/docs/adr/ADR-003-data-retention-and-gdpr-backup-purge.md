## Context
FitVibe processes user accounts, session logs, health-related workout data, and device/session metadata. GDPR requires **purpose limitation**, **data minimization**, **storage limitation**, and **the right to erasure** (Art. 5 & 17). We must define concrete **retention windows**, a **backup purge policy**, and a **restorable deletion** model that keeps backups lawful while enabling operational recovery.

## Decision
Adopt a **two‑phase deletion** (soft → hard) with **anonymization/pseudonymization** for analytics, and a **time‑boxed backup purge window**. Backups are encrypted and rotated; PII is purged from restorable media after the purge horizon.

### Retention & Deletion Model
- **Soft delete** user‑facing aggregates (e.g., sessions) via `deleted_at`.  
- **Hard delete** PII after grace periods; replace with anonymized aggregates when useful.
- **User Account Deletion (Right to Erasure)**:
  - Immediate **account lock**, sessions revoked.
  - Within **T+7 days**: hard delete credentials (`auth.credentials`), refresh tokens, access grants.
  - Within **T+30 days**: hard delete PII in `auth.users` (email, names). Keep non‑identifying aggregates only if anonymized (e.g., workout stats without links to `user_id`).
  - **Backup purge horizon**: **35 days** after T (≥ the longest online backup retention) to ensure erased data ages out from rotation.
- **Device/session metadata**: retain **90 days** for security/audit, then purge or anonymize (IP hashes truncated).
- **Audit trail for admin/security** (non‑content): retain **365 days**, then aggregate counts + drop PII.

### Backup & Restore Policy
- **Backups**: Daily logical backups (pg_dump) + weekly base with daily WAL (if PITR enabled). **AES‑256** at rest; keys in KMS.  
- **Retention**: **14 days** rolling window. After day 35, backups containing erased PII are no longer retained.  
- **Restore Handling**: On restore older than T+35, a **post‑restore erasure job** re-applies tombstones from `system.erasure_ledger` to ensure previously erased subjects stay erased.
- **Retention**: **14 days** rolling window. After day 14, backups containing erased PII are no longer retained.  
- **Restore Handling**: On restore older than T+14, a **post-restore erasure job** re-applies tombstones from `system.erasure_ledger` to ensure previously erased subjects stay erased.
 
### Data Map & Windows (MVP)
| Domain | Table(s) | Data Type | Retention | Deletion Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | `auth.users` (PII), `auth.credentials` | Email, names, password hash | Delete on request; otherwise **active + 24 months** inactivity | Hard delete PII; pseudonymize references |
| Sessions | `core.sessions`, `core.sets` | Workout logs | User delete → soft (immediate), hard at **30 days** | Soft→Hard, aggregate anonymized stats kept |
| Security | `auth.sessions`, `auth.refresh_tokens` | Device/session | **90 days** rolling | Hard delete |
| Audit | `system.audit_trails` | Events (low PII) | **365 days** | Aggregate & drop PII |
| Metrics | time‑series | Non‑PII labels | **13 months** | Natural TTL in TSDB |

### Anonymization & Pseudonymization
- Replace `user_id` with random surrogate keys in analytics tables.  
- Hash emails for dedup where strictly needed (salted).  
- Drop or bin precise timestamps when aggregating (e.g., day‑level).

### Operational Controls
- **Erasure Ledger**: `system.erasure_ledger(subject_id, issued_at, completed_at, scope)` used to replay deletes after restores.  
- **DPO Review**: Changes to retention windows require DPO approval and ADR amendment.  
- **Access Controls**: Only compliance role can view `erasure_ledger` contents.

## Consequences
- Satisfies storage minimization and erasure obligations while remaining operable.  
- Backup purge horizon prevents indefinite storage of PII in cold media.  
- Extra operational complexity (erasure replay on restores).

## Alternatives Considered
- **Immediate hard deletion incl. backups**: Non‑viable with realistic restore needs.  
- **Indefinite backups**: Non‑compliant (storage limitation).

## QA & Acceptance
- Unit/integration tests for erasure flow.  
- Quarterly restore drill must replay `erasure_ledger` without residual PII.  
- Compliance checks confirming retention jobs remove data by schedule.

## Backout Plan
If purge horizon causes operational risk, temporarily extend to **45 days** and document; never reduce without ensuring all existing rotations meet the new shorter window.

## Change Log
- **1.0 (2025-10-14)** Initial acceptance.
