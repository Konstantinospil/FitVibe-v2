# ADR-012: Monorepo Structure, Tooling, and Governance

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Author:** Reviewer  
**Cross-References:** PRD §7 Engineering Standards; TDD §0–§2 (stack & repo); QA §2–§9 (CI pipeline gates)

---

## Context
We maintain a single codebase that hosts backend, frontend, shared libraries, infra code, and test harnesses. The PRD and TDD establish **pnpm workspaces** as the standard, with optional **Turborepo** for task orchestration and caching, and **Docker Compose** for local orchestration. QA requires CI stages (lint → typecheck → unit/integration/E2E), coverage reporting, performance/a11y/security gates, and artifactized Docker images.

The decision must optimize for: fast local dev, reproducible CI, cacheable builds, clear boundaries, and auditability (CODEOWNERS, changesets, and release notes).

---

## Decision
1. **Repository Layout (top-level)**
```
fitvibe/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ backend/            # Node.js (Express) API
│  └─ frontend/           # React + Vite SPA
├─ packages/
│  ├─ shared/             # TS utilities, domain types, API SDK
│  └─ i18n/               # token catalogs and tooling
├─ tests/                 # e2e (Playwright), perf (k6), security configs
├─ infra/                 # docker-compose, k8s manifests (if any), scripts
├─ .github/               # workflows, CODEOWNERS, issue templates
└─ docs/                  # ADR index, architecture diagrams
```

2. **Package Management & Orchestration**
- **pnpm workspaces** with `link-workspace-packages=true` and `shared-workspace-lockfile=true`.
- **Turborepo** optional but recommended for pipeline caching (`turbo run build --filter=...`).  
- Enforce Node/PNPM versions via `.nvmrc` and `packageManager` field.

3. **TypeScript Project References**
- Each app/package is a TS project with references to enable incremental builds (`tsc -b`).  
- Disallow cross-layer imports that bypass public APIs via ESLint boundaries.

4. **Build & Run**
- Local: `docker compose up` provides Postgres, Redis, mailhog, and object storage (e.g., MinIO).  
- Apps can run outside Docker during dev, but **CI builds Docker images** using deterministic multi-stage Dockerfiles.

5. **Governance**
- **CODEOWNERS** per directory; **conventional commits**; **changesets** for versioning of published packages.  
- **Feature flags** centralized in `packages/shared/flags.ts`; defaults set by env and validated in CI (e.g., `FEATURE_UGC_AI_TRANSLATION=false` in prod).  
- ADR index maintained under `docs/` with bidirectional links to PRD/TDD sections.

6. **Environment & Secrets**
- Non-production secrets managed via `.env.example` and GitHub Environments; production via secrets manager (referenced by CI).  
- No secrets in repo; CI blocks on secret scanning hits.

7. **Caching & Artifacts**
- Turbo/pnpm cache in CI; Docker layer caching for images; test and coverage artifacts uploaded per job.  
- Reproducible builds pinned by lockfile; CI fails on lockfile drift.

8. **Testing & CI Pipeline (summary)**
- **lint** → **typecheck** → **unit** (vitest/jest) → **integration** (ephemeral DB) → **e2e** (Playwright) → **coverage upload** (Codecov) → **lighthouse** (CI) → **security scan** (deps + ZAP baseline) → **docker build & GHCR push** → **perf k6 smoke** with budgets → **policy gates**.  
- Budgets: API p95 < 300 ms; LCP < 2.5 s; CI fails on >10% perf regression.

9. **Release & Deployment**
- Backend/frontend images pushed to **GHCR** with semver tags; SBOM and provenance (SLSA generator) attached.  
- Manual approval gate for production; CD reads feature-flag defaults from environment configuration.

---

## Consequences
**Positive**
- Predictable local and CI builds; clear ownership and publish rules; cacheable tasks.  
- Strong alignment to PRD/TDD standards; QA gates enforce quality and budgets.

**Negative / Trade-offs**
- Turborepo adds one more layer of configuration (mitigated with templates).  
- Strict boundaries can slow ad-hoc cross-package imports (by design).

**Operational**
- Maintain workspace health checks (orphaned deps, circular refs).  
- Nightly job runs `pnpm dedupe`, dependency audit, and license checks.

## Alternatives Considered
| Option | Description | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Yarn workspaces | Use Yarn instead of pnpm | Not aligned with PRD/TDD; slower cold installs in CI |
| Polyrepo | Separate repos for backend, frontend, libs | Complicates shared types, versioning, and coordinated releases |
| Nx instead of Turbo | Use Nx for orchestration | Added complexity for our current scope; Turbo meets needs with less setup |
